### spoiler alert!

  - [x] At night you ahve to wear a pumpkin \(or mob skull, no player heads, though\) on your hat to stay safe from attacks.

  - [x] right-click a regular pumpkin to turn it into a spooky version ;\)
  - [x] when mining some blocks you may hear some spooky noises
  - [x] milking skeletals cows grants access to a strange substance called "bone milk" which almost entirely consists of purified calcium to make you stronger
